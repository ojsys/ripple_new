                <h2>1. Introduction to Investor Terms</h2>
                <p>These Investor Terms ("Terms") govern your participation as an investor on the StartUpRipple platform. By investing through our platform, you agree to be bound by these Terms, in addition to our general Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Please read these Terms carefully before making any investment.</p>

                <h2>2. Eligibility to Invest</h2>
                <p>To be eligible to invest through StartUpRipple, you must be of legal age in your jurisdiction and meet the accreditation or investor suitability requirements applicable to your location and the specific investment opportunity. You represent and warrant that all information you provide regarding your investor status is true and accurate.</p>

                <h2>3. Investment Risks</h2>
                <p>Investing in startups and early-stage companies involves significant risks, including the potential loss of your entire investment. Such investments are illiquid, speculative, and carry a high degree of risk. You should not invest any funds that you cannot afford to lose. StartUpRipple does not provide investment advice, and you are solely responsible for conducting your own due diligence and risk assessment.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Loss of Investment:</strong> Most startups fail, and you could lose all of the money you invest.</li>
                    <li><strong>Illiquidity:</strong> Investments made through the platform are highly illiquid, and there may be no secondary market for your investment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of Dividends:</strong> Many early-stage companies do not pay dividends and may never do so.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dilution:</strong> Your ownership percentage in a company may decrease over time if the company issues additional shares.</li>
                    <li><strong>Valuation Risk:</strong> The valuation of early-stage companies is highly subjective and may not reflect their true worth.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. Due Diligence</h2>

This includes reviewing all available information, asking questions of the entrepreneurs, and seeking independent professional advice (legal, financial, tax) as you deem necessary.</p>
